# language-awn package

The awn (as written notes) is a language of my own, mainly for making note purpose.  
The package is still in development. I will update progress when there comes so.
The grammar is already completely well designed, you can now apply its full syntax and have highlightings.

PS. Although I turned to use VS Code now for coding, I must say I do love Atom's UI and UX design. Therefore Atom is still my preferred editor for writting notes.
